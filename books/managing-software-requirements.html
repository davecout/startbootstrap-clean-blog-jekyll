title: "Managing Software Requirements"
subtitle: "A Use Case Approach"
author: "Dean Leffingwell et Don Widrig"
synopsis: "Despite the wealth of development knowledge, experience, and tools available today, a substantial percentage of software projects fail, often because requirements are not correctly determined and defined at the outset, or are not managed correctly as the project unfolds. This second edition of the popular text Managing Software Requirements focuses on this critical cause of failure and offers a practical, proven approach to building systems that meet customers' needs on time and within budget."
